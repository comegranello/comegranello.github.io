Here is my love, here are my hands: Joyce is worried when she sees so many people, her own people weighed down with poverty and conditioned by ignorance. She decides to go on studying to become a social worker and at the end of her course in Dar es salaam, a very important city in Tanzania, she gains experience in her job and she comes into contact with a small group of children.</p>

<p>She feels in her heart that: &ldquo;There is no bigger love than the people who are able to give their own life for their friends,&rdquo; for your friends, Lord, the children, your favourite ones.</p>

<p>Joyce has taken care of drop out children.She writes: &ldquo;I know I have to improve my vocational training, because the families don&rsquo;t know the importance of education. I have told their mothers that school is really important. But they have no money even to buy food so you can imagine, they can&rsquo;t bear the cost of exercise books, books, uniforms, which are compulsory, and all the other expenses. The children come from families whose fathers have left home and whose mothers have to manage to find a small portion of food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joyce is working for them but now she has decided to go to university because she thinks that if she improves herself, she will be able to help in a better way education. School is essential and capable of giving the right means to reach knowledge and learn a job.</p>

<p>Joyce knows that human being should be encouraged to grow fully and be free from miserable condition worthless to be lived.Joyce holds fast to her calling and puts into practice what her protectress Mother, Saint Magdalene of Canossa, said: &ldquo;School is a task which requires great effort and carefulness, but remember,  it gives us the best reward. It is, in fact, from education that our life usually depends on.&rdquo;</p>
